      "description": "Our Liquid Edition Eye Shadows have been a real winner since their launch and are a real first of their kind in natural and organic make-up. Whether you're looking for a striking or glamorous look for night time, or something more subtle and natural for wearing during the day, there is a shade for everyone. They dry quickly, and depending on the depth of colour desired, can be blended in on application or left to dry before blending for a more vivid look. Layering is also possible, but however you choose to use these liquid eye shadows they won't gather in crow's feet or fine lines around the eyes. The inclusion of patented beta glucan also means they're perfect for sensitive eyes. Pale Almond is subtle, natural, and perfect for daytime wear, and compliments our Bronzed Hazel liquid eye shadow if a duo tone is desired.",

Features:True instant colour in one stroke applicationLong wearing, easy-glide formulaNo dragSharpens with Milani’s Duo SharpenerNon-feathering formulaApplication: To outline your lips, make an X on the center of your upper lip (lip cleavage). Following the contour of your mouth, start from the outer edges of your lips and work your way towards center of your upper lip (where the x is marked). This will prevent from making one arch higher, pointier or rounder than the other.  Tip: Lipliner helps extend the wear & keeps your lipstick from feathering.   When choosing a lipliner shade, match the lipliner to your lipstick shade or match your lipliner to the shade of your lips which will work with all your lipstick shades.   Create a custom lipcolor by using a contrasting lipliner and lipstick shade.   Before applying your lipliner, pat your lips lightly with your foundation or pressed powder puff, which also helps keep you lipstick from feathering.

The formula is nonfading with lasting color fidelity over time, as the use of UV absorbers helps maintain the true colors. The lacquers maintain an excellent shelf life, with a formula that prevents pigment migration, striation, settling and syneresis over longer periods of time than most other nail enamel formulas.
